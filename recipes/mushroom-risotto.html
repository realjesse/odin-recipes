    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        Amid the rolling fields of Italy, where the soft hum of rice paddies 
        meets the forest's whisper, mushroom risotto took root, a dance of 
        earth's finest ingredients. Embracing the creamy alchemy of arborio 
        rice and the woodsy aroma of wild fungi, it became a testament to 
        culinary artistry, tradition, and the patience of stirring hands. 
        Today, its velvety texture and rich flavors bring warmth to tables 
        worldwide, celebrating the essence of simplicity and the soul of 
        Italian cuisine.

        The following recipe is taken from 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaRlFcQgdwI" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Billy Parisi's Best Creamy 
        Risotto Recipe</em></a>. He is absolutely one of my favorite chef's
        and I recommend anyone who is new to intermediate in cooking to check
        him out!  Careful though, this makes a lot! Consider sizing down.
